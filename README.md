## About This Project

This project prepared for a challenge. I used Next.js for my project and also tailwindcss.

This project is basically a single page web app which contains a list of users.

You can see 15 users at initial page , after you clicked Load button you can reach 15 more for each click.

If you are thinking you have a friend in this list a have a great news for you.

Also you can use search input to find your friend by name.
